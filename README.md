# n8n Keyword Research Agent

This GitHub repository demonstrates an n8n workflow designed for automated keyword research, intended for showcasing in technical interview scenarios. The project illustrates how to build a comprehensive SEO keyword analysis system by interconnecting various n8n nodes, including:

- HTTP Request nodes for API integration with Google Keyword Planner
- Function nodes with custom JavaScript for data transformation
- Google Sheets integration for result storage and visualization
- AI-powered keyword expansion capabilities

The workflow automates traditionally time-consuming SEO and PPC tasks by gathering keyword metrics, related terms, search volumes, and competitive analysis - all without human intervention once triggered.

## Technical Implementation

This demonstration showcases practical knowledge of:
- API integration and authentication
- Data transformation and filtering
- Workflow automation principles
- JavaScript implementation within n8n

## Purpose

This project is for testing and demonstration purposes only. It serves as a technical portfolio piece to demonstrate automation capabilities and n8n implementation skills.

## Note

This implementation does not store or process actual user data and operates exclusively within test environments.
